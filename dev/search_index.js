The integration of Trixi.jl with Compiler-Based (LLVM level) automatic differentiation via Enzyme.jl offers the following benefits: facilitates rapid forward mode AD, enables reverse mode AD, supports cross-language AD, and critically, supports mutating operations and caching, on which Trixi.jl relies, to enhance the performance of both simulation runs and AD. The final deliverable will include as many of Trixi's advanced features as possible, such as adaptive mesh refinement, shock capturing, etc., showcasing the benefits of differentiable programming in Julia's ecosystem.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"module"},{"location":"api.html#Module-Index","page":"API reference","title":"Module Index","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"api.html","page":"API reference","title":"API reference","text":"Modules = [TrixiEnzyme]\nOrder   = [:constant, :type, :function, :macro]","category":"page"},{"location":"api.html#Detailed-API","page":"API reference","title":"Detailed API","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"api.html","page":"API reference","title":"API reference","text":"Modules = [TrixiEnzyme]\nOrder   = [:constant, :type, :function, :macro]","category":"page"},{"location":"api.html#TrixiEnzyme.jacobian_enzyme_forward-Tuple{Any}","page":"API reference","title":"TrixiEnzyme.jacobian_enzyme_forward","text":"jacobian_enzyme_forward(semi::SemidiscretizationHyperbolic)\n\nUses the right-hand side operator of the semidiscretization semi and forward mode automatic differentiation to compute the Jacobian J of the semidiscretization semi at state u0_ode.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"api.html#TrixiEnzyme.pick_batchsize","page":"API reference","title":"TrixiEnzyme.pick_batchsize","text":"pick_batchsize(x)\npick_batchsize(semi)\n\nReturn a reasonable batch size for batched differentiation.\n\nArguments\n\nx: AbstractArray\nsemi: SemidiscretizationHyperbolic in Trixi.jl\n\nNotes\n\nInspired by https://github.com/EnzymeAD/Enzyme.jl/pull/1545/files\n\nwarning: Warning\nThis function is experimental, and not part of the public API.\n\nExamples\n\njulia> pick_batchsize(rand(3))\n3\n\njulia> pick_batchsize(rand(20))\n11\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"api.html#TrixiEnzyme.plusTwo-Tuple{Any}","page":"API reference","title":"TrixiEnzyme.plusTwo","text":"plusTwo(x)\n\nSum the numeric \"2\" to whatever it receives as input\n\nA more detailed explanation can go here, although I guess it is not needed in this case\n\nArguments\n\nx: The amount to which we want to add 2\n\nNotes\n\nNotes can go here\n\nExamples\n\njulia> five = plusTwo(3)\n5\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"Acknowledgments.html#Acknowledgments","page":"Acknowledgments","title":"Acknowledgments","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"Acknowledgments.html","page":"Acknowledgments","title":"Acknowledgments","text":"The entire project, along with this blog website, is developed and maintained by Junyi(@junyixu).
