# TrixiEnzyme

[Wikipedia's automatic differentiation entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_differentiation) is a useful resource for learning about the advantages of AD techniques over other common differentiation methods (such as finite differencing).

TrixiEnzyme is not a registered Julia package, and it can be installed by running:
```julia-repl
julia> Pkg.add("https://github.com/junyixu/TrixiEnzyme.jl.git")
